The git executable must be specified in one of the following ways:
    - be included in your $PATH
    - be set via $GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE
    - explicitly set via git.refresh(<full-path-to-git-executable>)

All git commands will error until this is rectified.

This initial message can be silenced or aggravated in the future by setting the
$GIT_PYTHON_REFRESH environment variable. Use one of the following values:
    - quiet|q|silence|s|silent|none|n|0: for no message or exception
    - warn|w|warning|log|l|1: for a warning message (logging level CRITICAL, displayed by default)
    - error|e|exception|raise|r|2: for a raised exception

Example:
    export GIT_PYTHON_REFRESH=quiet
